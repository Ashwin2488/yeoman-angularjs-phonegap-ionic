<h1><code ng:non-bindable=""></code>
<div><span class="hint"></span>
</div>
</h1>
<div><div class="custom-animations-page"><p>You can add your own animations. Here&#39;s how we would add our own animation called &#39;banana&#39;, which fades in an element from 0.5 opacity to 1 opacity.</p>
<pre><code>\@keyframes bananain {
  from { opacity: 0.5; }
  to { opacity: 1.0; }
}
\@keyframes bananaout {
  from { opacity: 1.0; }
  to { opacity: 0.5; }
}
.banana.in,
.banana.out.reverse {
  animation: bananain 350ms;
}
.banana.out,
.banana.in.reverse {
  animation: bananaout 350ms;
}</code></pre>
<p>And then, with the CSS included, you just need to tell angular-jqm that we have a new animation
class to register.</p>
<pre><code>JQM_ANIMATIONS.push(&#39;banana&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>Now you have a new &#39;banana&#39; animation, ready to use in page transitions or as a normal animation in something like ng-repeat.</p>
</div></div>
